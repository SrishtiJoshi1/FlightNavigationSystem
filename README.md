# FlightNavigationSystem
This system involves the scheduling of flights, air ticket reservations, flight cancellations, customer support, and staff management. Daily flights updates can also be retrieved by using the system.
Following are the steps to implement shortest path finding algorithm -
1.Defined simulation goals: shortest path, obstacle handling, and algorithm testing.
2.Modeled airspace as a 2D grid-based graph.
3.Successfully implemented:
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm A* Search Algorithm
4.Handled static obstacles(e.g., no-fly zones, weather blocks).
5.Developed a user-friendly GUI
Visual features include:
Start and end points Blocked zones
6.Users can interact with the interface for inputs and view results clearly.
7.Verified algorithms on small test cases.
8.Ensured correctness and visualization accuracy.
